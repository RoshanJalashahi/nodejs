Event loop is very important function of node js.
# working of event loop
1> first event is emitted.
2> Now, Event loop will look for that event.
3> then it will perform accoording to that event 
4> it will then call the callback function or arrow function after successfully doing that event to the particular one.

note that since, node js is a single threaded so never upload a heavy task because it can block the event.
node js can actomatically uploads a heavy task to the thread pool and does a simple task

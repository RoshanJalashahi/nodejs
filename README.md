 # Hi there today we creted a file system in nodejs with file synchronous way
 ## tomorrow we gone learn more about it'

 Synchronous node is also as know as Blocking code i.e If a ssystem is reading a bulk of file than it will block all the code until it reads all those bulk of code. Since nodejs is a single threaded
 it execute only one code at a time. 
 Asynchronous method is more applicable because it can handle other code while executing the bulk of code.
